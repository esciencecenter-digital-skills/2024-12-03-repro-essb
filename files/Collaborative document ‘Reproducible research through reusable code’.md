## 🥶 Icebreaker
- I would rather spend time on making my code reusable by others than on publishing my results
- Reproducible results are the only useful results

## Collaborative Notes

## List of GitHub projects
1. Share: Write down the link to your project in GitHub and the language it is written in.
2. Pick: Pick a project that you want to try to reproduce. Put your name behind it so everyone knows it is taken.
- R: https://github.com/agnebore/yelp_topic_modelling  - I like your script and git repository
-
- R: https://github.com/jpavlovic-epi/UpSetR-plot 
-
- Py: https://github.com/saramazz/genomit_PMD.git 
- Py: https://github.com/EZoetelief/EURcourse 
- R: https://github.com/Anouk-Bouma/SampleWorkshopData 
- Py: pip install dummypypi2  (https://pypi.org/project/dummypypi2/)  <- try command 'dummypypi2.utils.get_signed_angle(a, b, np.cross(a, b))', where a,b are 1d numpy arrays of the same length

## renv comment for R users
Before using `renv::snapshot()`, you have to call `renv::init()` > this will create a project library, a lock file and a .Rprofile file




## 💬 Feedback (before lunch)
Can you help us improve this workshop for the future and fit the afternoon part to your preferences?
Please write down one thing that went well and one thing that can be improved.

### 👍 What went well:
- Bridging the knowledge gap.Materials are great.
-  Highly detailed material, a proactive and productive atmosphere, and personalized one-on-one support.
-  clean and well understandable explanation. Lot of support and tons of useful materials.
- Exciting topic! I really like that there is so much follow up material. Even if we're only scratching the surface today I feel like it will be relatively easy to pick back up afterwards.
-
- Interessting course, with a lot of personal help were needed. 
- So much to learn!! I am really excited and happy to join you. Very detailed and helpful. The materials are nice to follow and useful. 
- Appreciate the introductory-level course, nice for those who have zero experience with version control.

### 🤔 What can be improved:

- Speed up the first part by sending an email before the event, explaining the importance of arriving with a folder containing the code. 2. I agree!!!
- Please include the room address in the email as well to make easier finding the room, plss - Yes, i agree
- Explain a bit more on git before the use of it. A global introduction should be nice. 
- Have people install GitBash beforehand - agree
- it might be easier if we all have the same sample project for the first part? 
- For me it was't clear that code needed to be shared. Could have prepared some partial code en bring it with me if i had known beforehand. Will make it work for now ;)
- It would be nice if links in the lesson materials open in a new tab instead of in the one you are working on
- Maybe there is a Youtube video in which we can watch as a prep?
    - Agree, some of the introductory concepts could have been reviewed in a video beforehand so more course content could be covered in-class
- add Black formatting for py
